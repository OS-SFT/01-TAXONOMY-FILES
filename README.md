## Taxonomy

Regulatory taxonomies have been provided by OS-SFT Componentry Partner, Corlytics. See below for these taxonomies:

#### EBA Pillar 3 ESG Disclosures 

[Insert Taxonomy Link / Document?]

#### Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

## Taxonomy Mapping

Mapping exercises have been completed to identify mcrossovers and differences between ISSB requirements and those of the above reporting regimes. See below for these mappings, which have been modelled using the data lineage tool provided by OS-SFT Componentry Partner, Solidatus:

#### [One model per mapping? Or one overall model?]

## Use Cases - Point Solutions

#### Irish Banks - EBA Pillar 3 Reporting

First Derivative, in partnership with Corlytics and Solidatus, has been working with a partner Irish bank to prepare for forthcoming reporting requirements under the EBA's Pillar 3 ESG Disclosure regime. 

##### Our Solution:
- FD have designed a solution that pulls in internal and external counterparty data directly from the sources into a model using Corlytics
- Uses a Solidatus model to show how data flows from source and maps to Template 1 of EBA Pillar III, and to begin building out the data profile of each counterparty
- The data is then grouped together by NACE code and totalled, then mapped to the relevant fields in the EBA Pillar III templates
- The model will have built in proxies to fill data gaps, reports on completeness and will enable the user to download reports
- This solution can be used beyond EBA Pillar III and lays the foundation for future regulatory reporting
- The aim is to enhance the model by enabling automated updates, including via connectors which will feed data scraped from external sources into the model
