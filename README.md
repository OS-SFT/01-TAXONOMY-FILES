## Taxonomy Mapping
Mapping exercises have been completed to identify crossovers and differences between ISSB requirements and those of the above reporting regimes.
- Comparisons were made across disclosure requirements spanning governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets including specific GHG emissions and exposure metrics and methodologies.
- This resulted in the identification of potential synergies with current reporting activities and data requirements, including how these might inform asset re-pricing and incorporation of climate risk metrics into existing risk practices. This is of particular interest to the evolving sustainable finance solutions being developed between [First Derivative](https://firstderivative.com/sustainable-finance/), [Corlytics](https://www.corlytics.com/), [Solidatus](https://www.solidatus.com/) and [Sustainable Finance Ireland](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/) with funding from [Skillnet Ireland](https://www.skillnetireland.ie/).
We see a future where end-to-end, multi-nodal taxonomy mapping becomes central to all operating models for data, risk, controls and reporting.

#### ISSB v TCFD
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112077283/187191045-d1b9df41-494f-488e-b496-7fb3bd6e09e5.png)
The ISSB has made a [comparison](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/project/climate-related-disclosures/comparison-draft-ifrs-s2-climate-related-disclosures-with-the-tcfd-recommendations.pdf) of the ideas and the recommendations of the FSB Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) available.
TCFD is the baseline in which the ISSB disclosures are based off but there are soem obvious differences from the 4 pillars of TCFD inclduing: 
* Governance
  * The Exposure Draft complies with the TCFD governance guideline; nonetheless, it calls for the disclosure of more governance-related information, including more precision on individuals' names, roles, and duties as well as particular controls and processes. Basically ISSB requires more granular and additional information whihc needs to be disclosed.
  
* Strategy
  * The Exposure Draft also takes a somewhat different tack when it comes to transition plans, and it makes clear demands on the disclosure of emission reduction goals and the usage of carbon offsets.
  * The Exposure Draft also requires some additional information regarding resiliency which might be helpful. 
  
* Risk Management 
  * With a few adjustments to the methods used to identify and prioritise opportunities, input parameters used to determine risks, and whether processes have changed, the exposure draft is compliant with the TCFD suggested disclosure.

* Metrics and Targets
  * Suggests a few extra particular disclosures that should be carefully read.
  * The TCFD advice and the Exposure Draft both call for the same types of cross-industry measurements. The Exposure Draft proposes new disclosure rules for industry-based indicators pertinent to an entity's sector and operations.
  * The Exposure Draft mandates a novel approach to the disclosure of greenhouse gases that must be carefully examined, and Scope 3 emission disclosure is now a prerequisite.

#### ISSB v EBA Pillar 3
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112077283/187191588-2b83a303-17ab-40d4-96be-1b78a3b07adf.png)

The EBA ESG Pillar 3 package will help to address shortcomings of institutions’ current ESG disclosures at EU level by setting mandatory and consistent disclosure requirements, including granular templates, tables and associated instructions. It will also help establish best practices at an international level. It is simalr to ISSB in the way that it sets out comparable quantitative disclosures on climate-change related transition and physical risks, including information on exposures towards carbon related assets and assets subject to chronic and acute climate change events. The main differences include: 
* The EBA appreciates the opportunity to participate in these consultainvolving ISSB and EFRAG and supports the introduction of international and European standards to meet the growing demand for comparable, accurate, and pertinent corporate data on sustainability-related issues. The EBA also recognises the importance of close coordination between the ISSB and EFRAG as they close out their own consultations to ensure consistency.
* As a tool to demonstrate how institutions are integrating sustainability considerations into their risk management, business models, and strategy as well as their path toward the Paris Agreement goals, EBA offers comparable disclosures and key performance indicators, such as a green asset ratio (GAR) and a banking book taxonomy alignment ratio (BTAR), in comparison to ISSB.
* The disclosure requirements implemented are organised by risk category just like ISSB and TCFD. The categories include governance, business modle and strategy and risk management. 
* To guarantee improved uniformity, comparability, and meaningfulness of these disclosures by institutions, the EBA has also established the disclosure dates, granular templates, tables, and instructions.

#### ISSB v SASB 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112077283/187191741-a5b40688-0e66-43e8-a8a6-07216cfc0750.png)

Since SASB develop sustainability accounting standrads most relevant to the financial performance in 77 industries, we can see a clear comparison with ISSB S2 appendix B as that identifies and discloses onformation on climate risks and opportunities for industries also. The industries we decided that would be most relevant to map and comparewere asset management and custody activities, insurance, commercial banls, investment banks and brokerage and mortgage finance. 

In order to ensure connection and compatibility between IFRS Accounting Standards and the ISSB's standards—IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards—the ISSB will work closely with the IASB. In order to give investors and other participants in the capital market comprehensive information to meet their needs, each board will be independent and their standards will complement one another. The creation of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards was fundamentally influenced by the sector-based SASB Standards. The ISSB has promised to expand upon the industry-based SASB Standards and utilise its method for developing standards that is also industry-based.
In comparion to SASB, ISSB has general requirementsand touches on governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets, as well as industry based discolsures which were derived From SASB Standards. 

#### ISSB v SEC

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112077283/187191870-84efc32f-09c3-49db-955d-f88e095e3bbc.png)
* The SEC's disclosure plans combine prescriptive rules-based disclosure requirements, which specifically specify issuers what must be given, with principles-based disclosure requirements, which provide the registrant significant choice over what information to disclose. The proposals' scopes significantly vary as well. The SEC plan only addresses climate change. The ISSB proposal now comprises broad rules and procedures for climate disclosure, but plans to include more ESG subjects in the future.
* Although the SEC's proposal for disclosure of information linked to climate change is restricted to climate, the agency's regulatory agenda indicates that it is likely to propose disclosure rules for other ESG-related issues, including board diversity, human capital, and cybersecurity. Although the scope of the ISSB's proposal is intended to broaden with subsequent exposure draughts, which are anticipated to eventually encompass the whole ESG landscape, it solely addresses climate and other environmental disclosure topics.
* ISSB is more aligned with TFCD than the SEC. With regard governance, strategy and risk, ISSB includes descriptions of transition plans and various scenario analysis and the difference with the SEC is that the disclosure is required only if the company uses the item and optional reporting of climate related opportunities

#### ISSB v EFRAG 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112077283/187192217-1f102891-479f-461b-b3c2-c7d9239aa097.png)
* A few comparisons and similarities include: ESRS and ISSB proposals include the four main pillars of TCFD to frame its proposal, while, in addition to the pillars, they integrate the underlying 11 disclosure recommendations of the framework. Both ESRS and ISSB introduce additional requirements and call for different
disclosure defnitions or locations for certain components, but otherwise fully align with TCFD guidance. 
* Companies should be prepared to calculate emissions to disclose for the FY23 reporting year because the ESRS and ISSB plans specifically ask for disclosure of Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions from an issuer's upstream and downstream value chains). In contrast to ESRS, which mandates Scope 3 disclosure regardless of materiality, IFRS leaves materiality up to users' and regulators' assessment because it cannot impose ISSB requirements across jurisdictions.
* The principles of the ISSB are founded on the idea of "single materiality, or those sustainability concerns that are important for generating company value. The double materiality" of sustainability issues, which have an impact on both the environment and society as a whole, is emphasised by EFRAG standards. Single versus dual materiality.
* The ISSB proposals is mainly investor based, whereas EFRAG focuses on a much wider and multi-staker holder basis.
* EFRAG requirements are much more granular published for sustainability impacts, risk and opportunities, while ISSB includes gneral requiremnts that is not only climate based but significant sustainablity related risks and opportunities. 

## Use Cases - Point Solutions

#### Irish Banks - EBA Pillar 3 Reporting

First Derivative, in partnership with Corlytics and Solidatus, has been working with a partner Irish bank to prepare for forthcoming reporting requirements under the EBA's Pillar 3 ESG Disclosure regime. 

##### Our Solution:
- FD have designed a solution that pulls in internal and external counterparty data directly from the sources into a model using Corlytics
- Uses a Solidatus model to show how data flows from source and maps to Template 1 of EBA Pillar III, and to begin building out the data profile of each counterparty
- The data is then grouped together by NACE code and totalled, then mapped to the relevant fields in the EBA Pillar III templates
- The model will have built in proxies to fill data gaps, reports on completeness and will enable the user to download reports
- This solution can be used beyond EBA Pillar III and lays the foundation for future regulatory reporting
- The aim is to enhance the model by enabling automated updates, including via connectors which will feed data scraped from external sources into the model
