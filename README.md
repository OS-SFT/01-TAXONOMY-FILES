# [1] TAXONOMY FILES

[Note - The Library is a collation of all taxonomy projects]

## Single Taxonomies
OS-SFT Service and Delivery Partner First Derivative has undertaken initial research and taxonomy analysis in relation to the following ESG disclosure regimes and regulations. Note that several of these regimes are at the proposal stage only and have not yet been finalised by the relevant bodies.

## Taxonomy Mapping
Mapping exercises have been completed to identify crossovers and differences between ISSB requirements and those of the above reporting regimes. Please see Batch 2 and 3 in the [Taxonomy Mappings Library](https://github.com/orgs/FD-SustainableFinance/projects/2) for details of the completed mappings: 
- Comparisons were made across disclosure requirements spanning governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets including specific GHG emissions and exposure metrics and methodologies.
- This resulted in the identification of potential synergies with current reporting activities and data requirements, including how these might inform asset re-pricing and incorporation of climate risk metrics into existing risk practices. This is of particular interest to the evolving sustainable finance solutions being developed between [First Derivative](https://firstderivative.com/sustainable-finance/), [Corlytics](https://www.corlytics.com/), [Solidatus](https://www.solidatus.com/) and [Sustainable Finance Ireland](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/) with funding from [Skillnet Ireland](https://www.skillnetireland.ie/).
We see a future where end-to-end, multi-nodal taxonomy mapping becomes central to all operating models for data, risk, controls and reporting.
