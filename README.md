# [1] TAXONOMY FILES

The initial focus of the OS-SFT project is the creation of a library of taxonomy files, for a variety of sustainability disclosure frameworks and other initiatives, in human and machine readable format. The below tables offer a summary of the taxonomies reviewed, which can also be viewed in the Project: [Taxonomy & Mappings Library](https://github.com/orgs/FD-SustainableFinance/projects/2).

## Single Taxonomies
The first set of taxonomies, relate to individual ESG disclosure regimes and regulations. Note that several of these frameworks are at the proposal stage only and have not yet been finalised by the relevant bodies. Details can also be viewed in Batch 1 of the [Taxonomy & Mappings Library](https://github.com/orgs/FD-SustainableFinance/projects/2).

## Taxonomy Mapping
In addition to the individual taxonomies, mapping exercises have been completed to identify crossovers and differences between the disclosure and/or regulatory requirements of the above regimes.
- Comparisons were made across disclosure and regulatory requirements spanning governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets including specific GHG emissions and exposure metrics and methodologies.
- This resulted in the identification of potential synergies with current reporting activities and data requirements, including how these might inform asset re-pricing and incorporation of climate risk metrics into existing risk practices. This is of particular interest to the evolving sustainable finance solutions being developed between [First Derivative](https://firstderivative.com/sustainable-finance/), [Corlytics](https://www.corlytics.com/), [Solidatus](https://www.solidatus.com/) and [Sustainable Finance Ireland](https://www.sustainablefinance.ie/) with funding from [Skillnet Ireland](https://www.skillnetireland.ie/).
We see a future where end-to-end, multi-nodal taxonomy mapping becomes central to all operating models for data, risk, controls and reporting.

Please see Batch 2 and 3 in the [Taxonomy Mappings Library](https://github.com/orgs/FD-SustainableFinance/projects/2) for details of the completed mappings, summarised below:
